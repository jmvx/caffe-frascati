<h1>Shop at Caffe Frascati</h1> 
<p>We worked with a coffee roaster in San Jose to come up with our 
own espresso coffee - blended and roasted to our specifications to produce 
authentic Roman-style espresso drinks. We chose only 100% arabica beans 
because they are far more flavorful than the cheaper beans used in most 
grocery store coffees. We blended the smooth, rich flavors of Africa with 
the subtle sweetness of Latin American beans to produce coffee with a 
smooth flavor and tempting aroma.</p>
